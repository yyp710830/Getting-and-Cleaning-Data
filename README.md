Read features.txt as a data frame,take the second column as a string vector,call "features_names".

Adjust the format of the variable name,eg:"t-body-acc-mean-x‚Äù.
The names(mean_and_std) divided into list.
Generate a new data frame,rows:339867 and cols:6,call "df".
The data set df's first column is a factor,contains two levels:t and f.
